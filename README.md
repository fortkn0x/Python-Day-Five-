# Day Five Python: Lists and For-Loops

# Lists and For-Loops

### Question of the Day
It is the zombie apocalypse. What would your weapon of choice be, what would you name it, and what does it look like? You can combine a max of three items. Walking Dead zombie rules.

### Exercises for Iniya
1. Show an example of a list, show that a list can contain ANY datatypes: int, float, boolean, string, and even another list.
2. Write a simple for-loop that asks the user to input a length of list, n, and then initializes a list of n integers using .append()--> show Iniya how to declare a list that is empty.
3. Given the above list, find the average of this set of numbers using a new for-loop. (Sum and then divide)
4. Show Iniya how to use .remove('element value') .pop() and .pop(index) on a list.
	5. Remove only removes the first instance of an element
	6. pop() without an index removes the last element from the list--> pop it off the stack! It returns the value of the element it removed
	7. pop(index) returns the value of the element it removed
5. Given a list of integer, remove all even numbers from the list.
6. Given a list of strings, remove all items that have a length less than 5 or something like that!P

### Daniel and Alex
Juan: work with Daniel to introduce some elementary concepts with lists and for-loops. Depending on how much Alex understood from yesterday, maybe have him work with Daniel on this. You can use my laptop. Try to be extremely encouraging!
`#list of best minecraft weapons`
`weapons= ["pickaxe", "shovel", "etc"]`
`print(len(weapons))`
`print(weapons[0])`
`print(weapons[2]`
`print(weapons[3]`
Try to write a while-loop that prints out each element of the list. print("one of my favorite weapons in minecraft is " + weapons[i])

After that, show them that they can build a list using .append and input. Have them write the program together and then they can take turns one-by-one inputting a single element. Maybe they can write a story together line-by-line and then print it out with a for-loop after.
